**Foreword: A note to METcalcpy users**

This User's guide is provided as an aid to users of METcalcpy.  METcalcpy is a
Python version of the statistics calculation functionality of METviewer,
METexpress, plotting packages in METplotpy and is a stand-alone package for any
other application. It is also a component of the unified METplus verification
framework. More details about METplus can be found on the
`METplus website <http://dtcenter.org/community-code/metplus>`_.

It is important to note here that METcalcpy is an evolving software package.
This documentation describes the |release| release dated |release_date|.
Intermediate releases may include bug fixes. METcalcpy is also able to accept
new modules contributed by the community. If you have code you would like to
contribute, we will gladly consider your contribution. Please send an email to:
`met_help@ucar.edu <mailto:>`__. We will then determine if we will be able to
include the contribution in a future version.

This User's Guide was prepared by the developers of METcalcpy, including
Minna Win-Gildenmeister, Tatiana Burek, David Fillmore, John Halley Gotway,
Dan Adriaansen, and Hank Fisher.

We thank the National Science Foundation (NSF) along with three organizations
within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA): 1) Office
of Atmospheric Research (OAR); 2) Next Generation Global Prediction System
project (NGGPS); and 3) United State Weather Research Program (USWRP), the
United States Air Force (USAF), and the United States Department of Energy
(DOE) for their support of this work. Funding for the development of MET-TC is
from the NOAA's Hurricane Forecast Improvement Project (HFIP) through the
Developmental Testbed Center (DTC). Funding for the expansion of capability to
address many methods pertinent to global and climate simulations was provided
by NOAA's Next Generation Global Prediction System (NGGPS) and NSF Earth
System Model 2 (EaSM2) projects. We would like to thank James Franklin at the
National Hurricane Center (NHC) for his insight into the original development
of the existing NHC verification software. Thanks also go to the staff at the
Developmental Testbed Center for their help, advice, and many types of support.
We released METv1.0 in January 2008 and would not have made a decade of
cutting-edge verification support without those who participated in the
original MET planning workshops and the now dis-banded verification advisory
group (Mike Baldwin, Matthew Sittel, Elizabeth Ebert, Geoff DiMego, Chris
Davis, and Jason Knievel).
