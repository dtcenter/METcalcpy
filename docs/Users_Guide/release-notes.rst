Version 1.0.0 release notes (20210511)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

New Functionality:

* Add calculations for Space-time Coherence Spectra from NOAA PSL Diagnostics Package (`#29 <https://github.com/dtcenter/METcalcpy/issues/29>`_)

* Utilize METdbload .stat file reader utilities to allow METcalcpy to read these files (`#31 <https://github.com/dtcenter/METcalcpy/issues/31>`_)

* Utilize METdbload .stat file reader utilities to allow METcalcpy to read these files (`#31 <https://github.com/dtcenter/METcalcpy/issues/31>`_)

* Create a template for reading in a data file (of raw data) and create a data file reader (`#7 <https://github.com/dtcenter/METcalcpy/issues/7>`_)

* Add new ECNT stats to aggregation logic (`#69 <https://github.com/dtcenter/METcalcpy/issues/69>`_)

* Implement a method that returns specified column values (`#73 <https://github.com/dtcenter/METcalcpy/issues/73>`_)

* Support for GridDiag analysis (`#53 <https://github.com/dtcenter/METcalcpy/issues/53>`_)

* Calculation of CTC stats added: LODDS, ODDS, ORSS, SEDI, SEDS, EDI, EDS stats to the ctc_statistics module** (`#60 <https://github.com/dtcenter/METcalcpy/issues/60>`_)

* Compute pairwise differences for "group" statistics (`#13 <https://github.com/dtcenter/METcalcpy/issues/13>`_)

* Add equivalence testing interval bounds to the existing continuous line type. Two fields are added:lower bound and upper bound (similar to calculating a normal confidence interval except it requires using the non-central t-distribution (`#1 <https://github.com/dtcenter/METcalcpy/issues/1>`_)

* Create coordinate converter for [0,360] to [-180,180] (`#21 <https://github.com/dtcenter/METcalcpy/issues/21>`_)

* Add calculations used for Hovmoller Diagram, as contributed from the NOAA PSL diagnostics package (`#28 <https://github.com/dtcenter/METcalcpy/issues/28>`_)

* Create a method for creating series permutations that creates results consistent with R (`#44 <https://github.com/dtcenter/METcalcpy/issues/44>`_)
